### Goal of the project:
The goal for this project is to create a website to visualize the change of the climate change. And It is clear to me the goal can be accomplished by using python, `streamlit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `meteostat`, `geopandas`, `folium`, and `scikit-learn` packages.
.
### The data 
It is clear to me the data for this project is acess the data from the website and store them locally in a data file.
### The code 
* The current code include a proper skeleton for starting this project. 
* This code so far can display the temperature plot. 
#### Contribution 
I created the file strucutre for the app.py. Also, I cleaned up the app.py a bit. So there is no need to have a chunk of codes in app.py. Instead, the function is imported from other py files. 
I also add a .gitignore file to omit unnecessary file to be uploaded into github.
